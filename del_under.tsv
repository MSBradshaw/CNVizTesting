No matter if it's in recitation or outside, she doesn't judge the simplicity of my questions and makes sure that I understand the course content. One aspect you should celebrate is her willingness to help anyone, and her patience. 	My only constructive feedback for Morgan is that sometimes, her explanations/feedback for our code/homework/classwork is a bit unaccessible. I remember in the first week, I was very lost because I had no coding experience but I went into recitation with the expectation that I knew what certain aspects of code meant, like #include <iostream> or what cout means. There are other times later in the semester where I have difficulty grasping certain concepts like loops, and sometimes it's difficult for me to pick up what she's saying. 			be wary that majority of the students in this course have never coded in their life before!

She is a very nice person and seemingly gets along with everyone.	I would probably say that she should challenge us more. Since a lot of the assignments we receive tends to be much harder than what we are taught. If she gave us harder assignments and still provides us support I would think that would really set us up.	Back what I remembered, she had everything set in stone. It didn't seem as though she is forgetting anything and we were going at a proper pace.	I would say to keep it more engaging. Granted, this issue is bound to happen for really any class I have but especially with computer science and watching how things are done is pretty boring for the most part.	Not really. The other TAs I have met are very kind and supportive as well but that is the most I know of them.

Tiffany starts with slides and a top town overview and explains everything, then goes into VS code and demonstrates, including an approach written out in pseudocode, comments, and common errors. There is always a clear path from concepts, to problem solving, to syntax. There are many opportunities to ask questions. We then go into independent practice, where she and the LAs are floating ready to ask questions. It's a good way to reinforce what we learned. Tiffany is extremely friendly and approachable and meets people where they're at. Every time I've emailed her she has gotten back to me within a couple hours. 	None!	Floats between rooms, and answers quickly when the "raise hand" feature is used. 	I know this is controversial, but I would like it if everyone had their cameras on.	None

Her teaching is engaging and does a good job of preparing us for homework assignments and her office hours are also very helpful.	I can't think of anything. I think Tiffany is a very good TA.	She was always very clear when giving instructions and told us where to find additional resources if we needed them.	For it not to be remote?	I don't have feedback for other TAs but Ash and Lita - LAs that help out in my recitation - are very kind and helpful whenever I have a question. I can tell both of them enjoy helping us code. Ash especially is always up beat and I feel like that makes our recitations much more engaging and fun.

My TA does not provide many opportunities to clarify that we are following what is going on. Sometimes I feel like I am lost and don't know what questions to ask to get my footing again. Leading questions relevant to what we are working on and reminders of basic concepts as we go could be helpful, like "So we are moving $rsp+0xc into $rbx. So what is $rsp? It's the stack pointer, so we are moving 0xc in the stack, and that's our first input'   It is also hard to understand his accent consistently, so using the whiteboard more often to visually draw out concepts and use labels is more valuable than just saying them and talking about what is on the screen.

She always answers questions incredibly promptly (mine and other students on Discord) and she's very patient with us. Generally, I'm an uncomfortable person and will not talk/ask questions unless I have to, but I feel very comfortable with Xu and am confident she's not going to respond judgmentally or with irritation if I ask a question or have input. Feedback she gives is also clear and helpful, and her slides are comprehensive and useful (I also really appreciate that she posts a link to them before recitation, as it helps me feel more prepared and like I know what to expect).	N/A	Xu leaves enough time for questions after she finishes speaking about something, and closely monitors the chat for questions/comments there as well, which is really helpful for students unable to use or uncomfortable with interjecting on their mic.

I would feel very comfortable asking questions or for clarification about class material/assignments, if I had them.	NA	Instead of randomly placing us in breakout rooms, she has been opening breakout rooms so that students can select one to join. This allows people the opportunity to choose with whom they work if they have a preference, without having to worry about making a specific request.

He takes difficult concepts, assess where we may not be comprehending concepts and gently guides us to find the answers within our preexisting/ancillary knowledge, all in a friendly manner which encourages future interactions. 	It is truly difficult to find an area of improvement in my interactions thus far, as he goes well beyond what is required or even asked to make sure we succeed if we are putting in the effort and eventually understanding. I guess I'd say just keep doing what you're doing and I bet you'll only improve with more instruction/mentoring experience . 	He is really flexible with availability. 	Maybe include a practical example in addition to the theoretical when lecturing. 	Anuj has also been really helpful in explaining material and helping facilitate the course.

He's really kind and willing to help out, even if it's with stuff that doesn't specifically relate to the coursework. For instance, I had questions about possibly pursuing a PhD in CS, and he was very kind to meet over Zoom with me to help clarify everything. I also needed help finding a PC to purchase, and he was kind enough to tell me what characteristics I should look for, as well as offering to look at the PC before I purchased it to see if it's good.	I honestly don't have anything to add. 	He doesn't just read through the slides, and he uses simple vocabulary which makes it really easy to understand him. I have very little experience in HTML, and I was always hesitant about taking a class about it, as I tried taking a course before at my old school and the teacher made it really hard to understand. But Wyatt actually explained everything so well that now I feel like I'm actually not that bad at HTML.	The audio sometimes cuts in and out, but I don't think it's his fault. It's probably my wifi. 	Wyatt, Nikita, and Kanaka have all been very wonderful and helpful. Kanaka isn't my TA, but I always join her office hours before my labs are due, and shes really helpful with explaining to me what things I did wrong. I especially struggle with technical issues, and shes very well-versed in it, so she's not only able to fix it for me, but she also teaches me how to fix it myself in case I come across the same issue later.

I think it would be a good idea to include an activity where the TA and students follow along and then check for understanding before moving on to a recitation assignment.
